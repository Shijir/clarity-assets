# Clarity Assets

This repository is part of the [Clarity](https://github.com/vmware/clarity) project, and its purpose is to store the static assets that we provide for consumers of Clarity.

You are welcome to download the files from here, or you can find them listed our website https://clarity.design as well.

### Versioning

The assets in this repository are versioned, so by default you'll see the latest version of any file. To find an older version, you'll need to use the GitHub branch switcher button to find an older revision. You can open the dropdown and find the corresponding branch, such as `v1.0` or you can also search for a specific revision by typing in the specific number such as `v1.0.3`.
